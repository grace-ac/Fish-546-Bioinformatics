__Sonication__ (applies sound energy to break down cells)
- Physical lysis is common method of cell disruption and extraction of cellular contents. Physical lysis not able to solubilize membrane-associated proteins.
- Reagent-based lysis methods using detergents not only lyse cells but solubilize proteins.

__Protein-stability__:
- Goals of cell lysis to purify or test function of particular protein however must consider the effects that lysis reagents have on stability and function of target proteins.


__Depletion and Enrichment__:
- Peptides from high-abundance proteins can mask detection of those from low-abundance proteins so it is best to reduce the complexity of your sample.
Protein enrichment can be used to isolate subclasses of cellular proteins based on unique biochemical activity, post-translational modifications or spatial localization within a cell.

__Protein Denaturation, reduction, alkylation, and digestion__:
- In solution: Use the reducing agent tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) for disulfide reduction. The free sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues are alkylated with reagents such as IAA to irreversibly prevent the free sulfhydryls from reforming disulfide bonds. The denatured, reduced, and alkylated proteins are then digested using endoproteinase Lys-C which hydrolytically breaks peptide bonds to fragments proteins into peptides.

__Dialysis and Desalting__:
- Samples whether simple or complex need to be processed to ensure they are compatible and optimize for digestion and analysis by mass spectrometry. Since MS measures charged ions, salts especially sodium and phosphate salts, they need to be removed prior to MS to minimize detection.

__Randomization__
- Random number generator to create order in which we run samples?
- We could take one random oyster seed sample from 2015 experiment- divide it into 6 replicates (A, B, C, D, E, F). Replicate A will be the first sample we digest in our randomized series for Block 1 and Replicate C will be the last sample we digest in that series. Replicate C will be the first sample we digest in Block 2 series and Replicate D will be last. Replicate E will be the first sample we digest in Block 3 series and F will be last. See table below.
