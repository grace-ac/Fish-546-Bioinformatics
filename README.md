My repository holding information for the oyster seed project

This experiment was conducted by @Ellior2 at the Taylor Shellfish Hatchery in Quilcene, WA. We are testing for differences in the proteome between oysters grown at 23C and 29C. Additionally we collected samples for Dr. Ralph Elston with Aquatechnics for histological analyses to complement this proteomic study.

**Notebook(s)**: Coming soon!

**Sample collection date(s) and personnel**: 9/6/15 to 9/20/15. Experiment conducted by @Ellior2

Per @sr320:

To clarify, we sampled the control silos of 23C and 29C everyday from Day 5-Day 14 post-set. We also sampled each of the other silos immediately before a transfer and every subsequent day after the transfer.



**Sample(s)**:
Here is entire list of samples collected. So far we have isolated the peptides and run MS/MS scan on 1,2,13,and 14.
